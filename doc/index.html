<h2>Getting Started Using the Address Book</h2>
<p>
LDAP Address Book is a web application for browsing and searching
for contact details within an LDAP directory service, allowing it
to be used as an address book. It has been tested on the following
LDAP directories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Directory (Microsoft and Samba implementations)
<li>Novell eDirectory
<li>OpenLDAP (provisional support)
</ul>
<p>
Searching your LDAP address book is pretty easy. Just type in
the name, job title or company of who you're trying to find into
search box and click "Search" (or press Return). Alternatively
if the directory has been classified into "organisational units"
(OUs) you can click on the folders underneath the search box to browse
records by department, building, etc.
</p>
<h3>Using OpenSearch</h3>
<img alt="Address book OpenSearch integration" src="opensearch.png">
<p>
You can add the LDAP Address Book to the drop-down list of search engines
in Firefox and other OpenSearch compliant browsers. To the Address Book
add as a Firefox search engine:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open web browser and navigate to the address book.
<li>Click the icon to the left of the search engine name in the search
box.
<li>Select <b>Add "Address Book"</b> (or the name of your address
book, if it has been changed from the default) from the menu.
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Installation and Basic Setup</h2>
<p>
The remainder of this document is aimed towards system administrators
setting up and configuring LDAP address book on your network.
</p>
<h3>Upgrading from Previous Versions</h3>
<p>
The general method of upgrading to a new version of the Address Book
is to replace the application's program files with those from the
new release.
</p>
<p>
In many cases your previous configuration (stored in file
<code>config.php</code>) can be reused with only minor changes
(if any). Details of what needs to be done for each version
can be found on the project Wiki:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/ldap-addr-book/wiki/Home/">
https://sourceforge.net/p/ldap-addr-book/wiki/Home/</a>
</p>
<p>
This information is available for version 0.10 onwards.
</p>
<h3>Installation on Linux: Apache HTTP Server on Debian/Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
Install Apache HTTP Server, together with PHP and PHP/LDAP integration:
</p>
<pre>
apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-intl php5-ldap
</pre>
<p>
Decide where you want to store the address book web site's files
and unpack the address book tar.gz file to the web site directory.
For the purposes of this guide, this location is assumed to be
<code>/srv/www/addressbook.example.org</code> and the URL of the
address book <code>http://addressbook.example.org/</code>, in
which case you might type:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir -p /srv/www/addressbook.example.org
cd /srv/www/addressbook.example.org
tar xvzf ~/ldap-addr-book-0.02.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>
Create the file
<code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/addressbook.example.org</code>
and add the following contents:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        DocumentRoot /srv/www/addressbook.example.org
        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.org
        ServerName addressbook.example.org

        ServerSignature email
        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

        LogFormat "combined"
        TransferLog /var/log/apache2/addressbook.example.org-access_log
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/addressbook.example.org-error_log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Enable the site by running the command:
</p>
<p>
<code>a2ensite addressbook.example.org</code>
</p>
<p>
Perform a graceful restart of Apache in order to re-read the
configuration and make the new web site live:
</p>
<p>
<code>apache2ctl graceful</code>
</p>

<p>
Finally create a DNS record for the address book web site, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>addressbook.example.org.	IN	CNAME	myserver
</pre>

<h3>Installation on Windows: Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS</h3>

<p>
In outline, the procedure to set up the LDAP Address Book to run
under Windows is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Install preferred web server (e.g. Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS).

<li>Download PHP 5, e.g. from 
    <a href="http://windows.php.net/download/">http://windows.php.net/download/</a>
    or a trusted mirror.

<li>Install PHP 5, ensuring that LDAP and INTL support are both enabled.

<li>Set up a new virtual host or folder for the Address Book and
    extract the install media to it.

<li>If necessary, create a DNS record for the address book web site.
</ul>

<h3>Set up access to the directory service</h3>
<p>
The LDAP Address Book will need at least one user login
account on the directory service in order to access its
contents. This can be either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A generic "default" user account, which typically
    provides read-only access for searching or browsing records.
<li>Individual (named) login accounts (e.g. admin/editing
    permissions in future versions of the Address Book)
</ul>
<p>
If you just want to get the LDAP Address Book up and running
quickly, set up a new user account that provides read-only
access to your directory, open the file <code>config.php</code>
in your preferred text editor and fill in
<code>$ldap_default_user</code> and
<code>$ldap_default_password</code> with the account's
credentials.
</p>
<p>
You will also need to fill in the following settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ldap_server_type</code> - Either <code>"ad"</code> (for
either Microsoft or Samba Active Directory), <code>"edir"</code>
(Novell eDirectory) or "openldap" (OpenLDAP) as appropriate.

<li><code>$ldap_link</code> - Enter the host name of the directory server
(domain controller) to connect to.

<li><code>$ldap_base_dn</code> - Set to the location in the directory
(e.g. OU) that should be used as the "root" of the address book information.
</ul>
<p>
See the "Configuration Reference" section below for further
information on these and other settings.
</p>
<p>
Note: Windows users may experience problems opening the <code>config.php</code>
file using the Notepad text editor. Try downloading and using
Notepad++ instead, which supports correct handling of UNIX-style
newline characters.
</p>
<p>
Note: Some LDAP directory servers may allow read only access
with a blank user name/password ("anonymous
bind"). If this is the case then you may find that you
don't need to create a new user account or fill in
<code>$ldap_default_user</code> or <code>$ldap_default_password</code>
at all.
</p>

<h2>Customising the Address Book</h2>

<h3>Configuring users and permissions</h3>
<p>
The LDAP address book supports logging in with named user
accounts. Typically, this would be used for administrators
who are permitted to edit the address book contents (in a
forthcoming future version), or to limit browsing/searching
access.
</p>
<p>
Set the following option in <code>config.php</code> to enable
different users to log into the directory:
</p>
<pre>
$ldap_login_enabled = true;
</pre>
<p>
Login users, passwords and permissions are taken from the
LDAP directory rather than the LDAP address book application
itself, according to information in the configuration
setting <code>$ldap_user_map</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each entry in <code>$ldap_user_map</code> specifies how a login name for
    the address book maps onto a back-end LDAP directory user
    and permissions.
<li>The special <code>__ANONYMOUS__</code> entry specifies the
    login details to use when nobody is logged in. This
    typically provides read-only access.
<li>The special <code>__DEFAULT__</code> entry applies to any
    valid LDAP login that does not have its own individual
    entry in the user map.
</ul>
<p>
Each entry in the user map may have the following permissions
set:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Permission</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>allow_browse</code></td><td>Allows the user to browse through
 organisational units (folders) within the address book.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>allow_search</code></td><td>Allows the user to search the
    address book directory tree.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>allow_view</code></td><td>Allows the user to click on a record
    to see full details</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When connecting to Active Directory, the <code>ldap_name</code>
setting should correspond to a user principal name (UPN), e.g. 
the user name followed by <code>@</code> followed by the DNS domain name.
The <code>__DEFAULT__</code> user map entry for the
<code>example.org</code> AD domain might be configured as follows:
</p>
<pre>
array("login_name"=&gt;"__DEFAULT__","ldap_name"=&gt;"__USERNAME__@example.org",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
        )
</pre>
<p>
(Replace <code>example.org</code> with a valid UPN suffix for your own
directory, e.g. the domain name itself).
</p>
<p>
The token <code>__USERNAME__</code> will be replaced with the name that was
entered into the login box. An LDAP login name of <code>__DENY__</code> will
deny access to the directory.
</p>
<p>
The following example will allow users to browse and search
without having to log in. (The LDAP directory will be accessed as
user <code>ldap-browse@example.org</code>, password
<code>foobar</code>), or an administrator to log on with user
name <code>admin</code>. The administrator's directory access
will utilise the login name <code>Administrator@example.org</code>.
</p>
<pre>
array("login_name"=&gt;"admin","ldap_name"=&gt;"Administrator@example.org",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
	),
array("login_name"=&gt;"__DEFAULT__","ldap_name"=&gt;"__DENY__",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
	),
array("login_name"=&gt;"__ANONYMOUS__","ldap_name"=&gt;"ldap-browse@example.org",
	"ldap_password=&gt;"foobar",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
	)
</pre>
<p>
This allows only <code>admin</code> to log in, which is mapped to the
directory's <code>Administrator</code> user. (Other staff will be limited
to anonymous read-only access)
</p>
<p>
The following example will disable anonymous access, requiring users
to log in before they can browse the directory.
</p>
<pre>
array("login_name"=&gt;"__DEFAULT__","ldap_name"=&gt;"__USERNAME__@example.org",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
	),
array("login_name"=&gt;"__ANONYMOUS__","ldap_name"=&gt;"__DENY__",
	"ldap_password=&gt;"foobar",
        "allow_browse"=&gt;true,
        "allow_search"=&gt;true,
        "allow_view"=&gt;true
	)
</pre>
<h3>Changing the attributes shown for search results</h3>
<p>
The fields/attributes that are used when searching can
be customised by editing the contents of $search_ldap_attrib
in the configuration file. The default set of attributes that get
searched are:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description (typical usage)</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>cn</code></td><td>Name of the directory entry itself
    (usually a person's full name or "common name")</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mail</code></td><td>E-mail address</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>sn</code></td><td>Surname</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>displayName</code></td><td>Perferred display version of
    user's name. Some users may prefer informal versions of their
    name (e.g. "Andy" instead of "Andrew"), which would be represented
    here.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>company</code></td><td>Company name</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>title</code></td><td>Job title</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
See you directory service's schema documentation for
other attributes which are available to be searched.
</p>
<p>
The columns that appear in search results can be changed
by editing the contents of <code>$search_result_columns</code> in the
config file.
</p>
<h3>Applying language-specific sorting rules for search results</h3>
<p>
Certain languages and countries have their own specific sorting
rules (e.g. the sequence in which alphabetic characters follow each other).
Where necessary, these rules can be selected through the
<code>$lc_collate</code> setting in <code>config.php</code>:
</p>
<p>
<code>$lc_collate = "&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;codeset&gt;][@&lt;modifier&gt;]";</code>
</p>
<p>
In most cases only the language and territory need to be defined,
for example:
</p>
<p>
<code>$lc_collate = "en_US";</code>
</p>
<p>
(In practice neither the code set or modifier are widely used, and a
code set of UTF-8 will be assumed automatically.)
</p>
<h3>Applying custom LDAP filters to directory browsing and searching</h3>
<p>
If is possible to customise the LDAP queries which are used to fetch
data from the directory, for example to display only records which
have specific object classes or meet some other criteria.
</p>
<p>
Sites with Microsoft Active Directory/Exchange may wish to set up
custom filters that test the <code>msExchHideFromAddressLists</code>
and/or <code>showInAddressBook</code> attributes in order to exclude
those entries which are hidden from Exchange's Global Address Book
(GAL).
</p>
<h4>Directory browsing</h4>
<p>
When the user browses through the directory tree directory, the
address book retrieves all records at the user's location
(LDAP base search) that match the criteria specified
by <code>$browse_ldap_filter</code> in <code>config.php</code>.
The default LDAP filter is as follows, which allows all
objects to be displayed:
</p>
<p>
<code>$browse_ldap_filter = "objectClass=*";</code>
</p>
<h4>Search results</h4>
<p>
Searches results are retrieved by carrying out an LDAP
subtree search from the root of the address book (as
specified in <code>$ldap_base_dn</code>). The expression to be searched
for is based on the value of <code>$search_ldap_filter</code>
in <code>config.php</code>. The default LDAP filter is as
follows, which limits search results to objects representing
people:
</p>
<p>
<code>$search_ldap_filter = "(&(objectClass=person)___search_criteria___)";</code>
</p>
<p>
The token <code>___search_criteria___</code> will be replaced with an
expression to search the attributes listed in <code>$search_ldap_attrib</code>
for the string entered by the user. For example if the user searched
for "smith", the token would be replaced by:
</p>
<p>
<code>(|(cn=smith)(mail=smith)(sn=smith)(displayName=smith)(company=smith)(title=smith))</code>
</p>
<p>
To allow all object types to appear in search results, including
organisational units (which typically do not have a <code>cn</code>
attribute set), make the following changes to <code.config.php</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>$search_ldap_filter = "___search_criteria___";</code>
<li>Add <code>ou</code> to the list of attributes to be searched
    in <code>$search_ldap_attrib</code>.
</ul>
<h3>Changing the layout and attributes shown for directory entries</h3>
<p>
You may want to customise the way in which address book
entries are displayed - which fields/attributes are
used and how they are laid out. The columns that appear
in search results can be changed by editing the contents of
<code>$entry_layout</code> in the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
As shipped, address book entries are displayed in three
"sections":
</p>
<img alt="Default address book layout, with personal, business/work and additional notes sections" src="layout.png">
<p>
The sections appear in <code>$entry_layout</code> as
a comma-separated list of arrays. The first section in
the screenshot above ("Personal") is represented like
this:
</p>
<pre>
$entry_layout = array(
        array("section_name"=&gt;"Personal",
                "attributes"=&gt;array(
                        array("displayName",                    "Preferred Name",       "contact24.png"),
                        array("mail",                           "E-mail",               "mail.png"),
                        array("homePhone",                      "Home Phone",           "landline-phone.png"),
                        array("mobile",                         "Mobile Phone",         "cell-phone.png"),
                        array("wWWHomePage",                    "Web Page",             "internet.png"),
                        array("streetAddress:l:st:postalCode",  "Postal Address",       "address.png"),
                        array("c",                              "Country",              "country.png")
                        )
                ),

		// ... data for the other sections continues here (not shown) ...
		// ... sections are separated from each other by commas ...

	);
</pre>
<p>
You can define the following settings for each section:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Description</th><th>Default if not set</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>section_name</code></td>
    <td>Title to appear above the section.</td>
    <td>Title is not shown.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>new_row</code></td>
    <td>Whether or not this section should start on a new row.<br>
        In the default setup the "Business/Work" section has
        <code>"new_row"=&gt;false</code> set, so it is displayed to
        the right of "Personal" on the same row. "Additional Notes"
        has <code>"new_row"=&gt;false</code> set, so appears on its
        own row below the previous sections.</td>
        <td>Assumed to be <code>false</code></td></tr>

<tr><td><code>width</code></td>
    <td>Width of the section, specified as a number followed by
        any of the following measurement units (which are those
        supported by the CSS standard):
        <ul>
        <li>% - percentage of the available width
        <li>px - pixels
        <li>em - current font size (traditionally the width of the letter
                 "m" in the font)
        <li>ex - half current font size (traditionally the height of the
                 letter "x" in the font; or the distance between the font
                 baseline and median)
        <li>cm - centimetres
        <li>mm - millimetres
        <li>in - inches
        <li>pt - points (1/72 of an inch)
        <li>pc - picas (1/6 of an inch, or 12 points)
        </ul>
        In the default setup the width of "Business/Work" is set
        to "50%". Any sections on the same row that don't have a
        specified width will automatically use up the remaining
        space.</td>
    <td>User's browser divides up the available width based on
        amount of data to be shown in each section</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>colspan</code></td>
    <td>Number of HTML table columns that this section should span.<br>
        In the default setup the "Additional Notes" section has
        <code>"colspan"=&gt;2</code> set, so spans the width of both
        the "Personal" and "Business/Work" columns.</td>
    <td>Assumed to be <code>1</code></td></tr>

<tr><td><code>attributes</code></td>
    <td>List of attributes to appear in the section.</td>
    <td>(always required)</td></tr>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Each attribute is described by three items:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the LDAP attribute (or list of attributes) to be displayed
<li>The caption text to appear next to the attribute (or leave
    empty - "" - for no caption)
<li>Icon image to appear next to the attribute (or leave empty for none)
</ol>
<p>
A display field can be constructed from several LDAP attributes. To
construct a field from multiple attributes, list the attributes in
turn, separating them with one of the following symbols:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>:</code></td><td>Separate attributes with a line break</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>+</code></td><td>Separate attributes with a space</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This facility is often used to display the lines of an address.
(If the address attributes in your LDAP directory are used to store
business addresses rather than personal addresses you may want
to relocate the "Address" field from the "Personal" to the
"Business/Work" section of the display.)
</p>
<p>
The following changes will be applied automatically:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any web page URLs and e-mail addresses will be presented as
    clickable HTML links.</p>
<li><p>The <code>postalCode</code> attribute is followed by a
    "View Map" link that displays the corresponding location
    in Google Maps (provided that the postal code is valid and
    recognised).</p>

<li>Images contained in the <code>jpegPhoto</code> and
    <code>thumbnailPhoto</code> attributes will be scaled to the
    size indicated by <code>$photo_image_size</code> in
    <code>config.php</code> (96x96 pixels by default). If this
    value is not set then the images will be shown at their native
    size.
</ul>

<h3>Displaying thumbnail photos when browsing/searching the directory</h3>
<p>
By default, directory entries are displayed next to an
icon representing their object class. If one is available, 
an image representing the object - typically a photo - can be
displayed in place of the icon. These images are retrieved
from the <code>jpegPhoto</code> and/or <code>thumbnailPhoto</code>:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>jpegPhoto</code></td><td>Used to store one or
   more images of a person using the JPEG File Interchange
   Format. (Standard ref: IETF RFC 2798) In practice the
   address book will only display the first stored image.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>thumbnailPhoto</code></td><td>Stores a single
    thumbnail image, maximum size 100K. (Non-standard/Microsoft
    specific)</td>
</table>
<p>
The LDAP Address Book can also display PNG, GIF, WBMP, and GD2 images
stored in these attributes, although JPEG is recommended in all
cases. (WBMP is not the same thing as Microsoft Windows BMP,
which is not supported.) Your PHP installation must have
GD Graphics Library support enabled in order to display image
attributes.
</p>
<p>
To enable display of these images, set one or both of the following
options in <code>config.php</code>:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>$enable_search_browse_thumbnail = true;</code></td>
    <td>Display thumbnail photos when browsing and in search results</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$enable_ldap_path_thumbnail = true;</code></td>
    <td>Display thumbnail photo in detail view navigation path</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Beware that setting <code>$enable_search_browse_thumbnail = true</code>
can result in slow page loading if there are a large number of
images to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
A larger version of these images can be shown on the entry's
detailed view by adding the <code>jpegPhoto</code> and/or
<code>thumbnailPhoto</code> to the display layout (as described
in the previous section). The following settings control the image
size:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Default value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>$thumbnail_image_size</code></td>
    <td><code>24x24</code></td>
    <td>Size of thumbnail images displayed in search results
         and/or detail view navigation path, measured in pixels. For
         optimal layout the size should be the same as the icons
         used to represent object schema classes (24x24 as shipped).
         </td></tr>

    <td><code>96x96</code></td>

<h3>Changing the links shown in the page footer</h3>
<p>
The links shown in the page footer can be changed using the
<code>$site_footer_links</code> option in <code>config.php</code>.
The default set of links are defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$site_footer_links = array(
        array("url"=&gt;"doc/","text"=&gt;"User Guide"),
        array("url"=&gt;"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-addr-book/",
                "text"=&gt;"Get Source Code")
        );
</pre>
<p>
Each link is represented by an array containing its URL and the
name/label text to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
Note: The application's software license requires that you provide
users with a means of obtaining a copy of the source code. As such
you are recommended not to remove the "Get Source Code" link from
the footer, although you may change it to a more appropriate URL
where necessary (e.g. to a copy containing your own local changes,
or if users have only limited connectivity to the external Internet
that would prevent them from accessing the default location.)
</p>
<p>
Please see the <a href="license.html">license agreement</a> for
full information.
</p>
<h3>Changing the look and formatting of the address book</h3>
<p>
The appearance (such as font, text size, colours, etc) of the
address book is defined in the file <code>styles.css</code>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../styles.css">Take a look at the stylesheet file
(<code>styles.css</code>)</a>
</p>
<p>
You can change any of these settings (or add your own) by creating
your own stylesheet file, called <code>styles_local.css</code> and
adding your changes to it. (Although you could modify
<code>styles.css</code> directly it will be easier to upgrade to
future versions of the address book if you keep your changes
separate by using <code>styles_local.css</code> instead.)
</p>
<p>
The stylesheet file is made up of
<span style="font-style:italic">selectors</span> which specify which
part of the user interface is to be changed, followed by
<span style="font-style:italic">style directives</span> surrounded
by {...} to define how it should appear. For example, if you wanted to
dispay the address book in a different font you might add
the following to your own <code>styles_local.css</code> file and
change the <code>font-family</code> setting to your own choice of font:
</p>
<pre>
body,table {
        font-family:serif;
}
</pre>
<p>
Where you don't redefine a setting in <code>styles_local.css</code>
(such as <code>font-size:10pt</code> in this example) the value
from <code>styles.css</code> will continue to be used.
</p>
<p>
The following table summarises the CSS selectors used within
<code>styles.css</code> and which part of the address book's
appearance they affect:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>CSS Selector</th><th>Typically used to change the font, size,
        colour, etc, of...</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>body,table</code></td>
    <td>The address book as a whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>.ldap_navigation_path th</code></td>
    <td>The address book title, which is shown as the left-most item in the
        "Navigation Path" shown at the top of each page.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>.ldap_navigation_path td</code></td>
    <td>Organisational units, folders, etc, shown in the
        "Navigation Path" at the top of each page. The left-most
        element of the navigation path (typically used to show
        the address book title) is styled separately, described
        above.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>.page_footer</code></td>
    <td>Page footer.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">
    <code>.ldap_entry_viewer_section .column_header,<br>
        .search_results_viewer .column_header</code></td>
    <td>Column headers/titles used in search results and
        directory entries.(*)</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>.ldap_entry_viewer_section td,<br>
        .search_results_viewer td</code></td>
    <td>Data displayed in search results and directory entries.(*)
        Note: The appearance of LDAP attributes can be customised
        individually, as described below.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>.ldap_entry_viewer_section th</code></td>
    <td>Name/label text that appears to the left of each
        attribute shown in a directory entry.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
(* These may be split into two separate style declarations if
you want to customise the search results and directory entry
detail pages separately.)
</p>
<p>
You can also change the way in which an individual LDAP attribute
is displayed by applying style directives to
 <code>.ldap_attribute_&lt;attrib&gt;</code>,
where <code>&lt;attrib&gt;</code> is the attribute to be
customised. <p>For example, adding the following to
<code>styles_local.css</code> will cause home telephone numbers
(stored in the <code>homePhone</code> attribute) to be displayed
in italic:
</p>
<pre>
.ldap_attribute_homePhone
{
        font-style:italic;
}
</pre>
<p>
As a further example, adding the following to <code>styles_local.css</code>
will display SSH public keys (stored in the <code>sshPublicKey</code>
attribute) to be displayed in a fixed-width font and word-wrapped more
appropriately:
</p>
<pre>
.ldap_attribute_sshPublicKey
{
        font-family:monospace;
        word-break:break-all;
}
</pre>

                <code>$site_name = "BigCorp Address Book";</code>

	values are accepted:<br>&nbsp;<br>
        <code>ad</code> - Microsoft Active Directory
        (or Samba 4 Active Directory)<br>
        <code>edir</code> - Novell eDirectory<br>
        <code>openldap</code> - OpenLDAP (core/inetorgperson schema)

        </td></tr>

<tr><td><code>$ldap_link</code></td><td>Creates a connection to the
    LDAP server holding the address book data.

    <p>Example:<br><code>$ldap_link = ldap_connect("dc1.example.org");</code></p>

<p>Active Directory-specific Options:</p><p>
    (1) As an alternative to giving the name of a specific server (domain
    controller) you can specify just the domain name. This will load
    balance the connections across the available domain controllers.
    (See Microsoft KB 842197 for further information on how to use DNS
    netmask ordering for more fine-grained control of the servers
    used for load balancing.)</p>
    <p>
    (2) For multi-domain forests, specify the LDAP port number as 3268
    in order to use the AD Global Catalogue. (By comparison, using the
    default LDAP port (389) will return incomplete information other
    than for the local AD domain.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Examples:<br>
    <code>$ldap_link = ldap_connect("example.org");</code>
     - load balances across the DCs as listed in DNS<br>
    <code>$ldap_link = ldap_connect("dc1.example.org",3268);</code>
     - use AD global catalogue port
