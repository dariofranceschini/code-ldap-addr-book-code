/** Array of loadable OpenLDAP overlay modules

    The following overlays are built into other parts of OpenLDAP
    and do not exist as standalone modules:

	chain - built into back_ldap
	denyop - built into slapd
	glue - built into slapd

   The back_sock module contains both backend and overlay functionality.
   For the purposes of including it in either $openldap_overlay_module or
   $openldap_backend_module it is considered to be a backend.
